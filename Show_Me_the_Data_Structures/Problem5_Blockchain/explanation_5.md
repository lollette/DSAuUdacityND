# Problem 5: Blockchain

## Reasoning


	Insofar as the basic behavior of the blockchain follows that of a linked list, it has the same time complexity when appending
	one block and same space complexity. Namely `O(1)` time since we kind of keep tracking the tail and `O(n)` space where
	`n` is the number of transactions added .
